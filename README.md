## Microsoft Malware Classification 
[CODE](https://github.com/arun-kumar-c-s/Microsoft-Malware-Classification-Challenge)
- In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify assembly code and byte files into 9 different malware families. I worked with a dataset of 200GB of machine code, using multiprocessing and the Google Compute Platform to efficiently process the data.

- I implemented feature extraction using unigram and bigram approaches on hexadecimal pairs, as well as by converting assembly files into image files and extracting pixel features, commands, and headers. I reduced the number of features from 140000 to 1900 using feature selection techniques including chi2, annova, and mutual info scores.

- I trained the model using lightgbm and optimized it using hyperopt (bayesian optimization). The resulting model achieved high accuracy (99.88%) and low log loss (.016), as well as high precision and recall scores. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in detecting malware.

- Throughout this project, I demonstrated my skills in machine learning, data processing, and model optimization and evaluation.
